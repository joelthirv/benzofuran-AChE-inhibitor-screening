# In Silico Study of Substituted Benzofuran Derivatives Targeting AChE for Alzheimer's Therapy

This repository contains the project files from an M.Sc. research study focused on the computational screening of substituted benzofuran derivatives as potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) for Alzheimer's disease treatment.

## 🧠 Project Summary
- **Tool Used**: Schrödinger Suite (LigPrep, Prime, Glide)
- **Target Protein**: Human Acetylcholinesterase (modeled using PDB ID: 4EY7)
- **Lead Compound**: 2-(2-Phenylethyl)-6-(2-hydroxyethyl) benzofuran
- **Docking Score**: -10.801 (XP GScore)
- **Comparison Drug**: Donepezil (-11.37)

## 📁 Project Files
- `project-report.pdf`: Full research thesis
- `docking_results.csv`: XP GScores and ligand interaction metrics
- `interaction_diagram.png`: 2D ligand–receptor visualizations

## 🔍 Key Findings
- The lead compound showed strong hydrogen bonding and π–π interactions with AChE catalytic triad and peripheral anionic site residues.
- Demonstrated good drug-likeness (Lipinski compliant) and low predicted toxicity.
